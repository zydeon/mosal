/****************************************************************************

 It computes the set of non dominated scores for the #Matches-#Indels problem.
 It is a Dynamic Programming (DP) with pruning approach, by filling a DP
 matrix - P (with dimensions (M+1)*(N+1), where M and N are the sizes of the
 1st and 2nd sequence respectively).
 Each entry P[i,j] will store the set of states corresponding to Pareto
 optimal alignments of subsequences (a_1,...,a_i) and (b_1,...,b_j).
