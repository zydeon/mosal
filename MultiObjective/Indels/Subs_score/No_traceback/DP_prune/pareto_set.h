 It computes the set of non dominated scores for the "Substitution score"-#Indels
 problem without traceback (only final scores). It is a Dynamic Programming
 (DP) with pruning approach, by filling a DP matrix - P
 (with dimensions (M+1)*(N+1), where M and N are the sizes of the 1st and
 2nd sequence respectively).
 Each entry P[i,j] will store the set of states corresponding to Pareto
 optimal alignments of subsequences (a_1,...,a_i) and (b_1,...,b_j).
