/****************************************************************************

 It computes the set of non dominated scores for the #Matches-#Gaps problem
 without traceback (only final scores). It is a Dynamic Programming
 (DP) with pruning approach, by keeping three DP matrices: Q, S and T
 (with dimensions (M+1)*(N+1), where M and N are the sizes of the 1st and
 2nd sequence respectively).
 Each entry S[i,j] and T[i,j] will store the set of states corresponding 
 to Pareto optimal alignments of subsequences ending with ('-',b_j) and
 (a_i,'-'), respectively.
 Each entry Q[i,j] will store the states corresponding to Pareto optimal
 alignments of subsequences ending with (a_i,b_j) computed in S[i,j] and T[i,j].
